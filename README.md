![Cover_Image](cover/salonthumbnail.png)

## 📌 Overview

**LUME Salon** is a modern **microservices-based salon appointment system** designed to provide a seamless experience for customers to browse services, book appointments, and make payments online.

This repository contains the **Frontend Web Application** built using **Next.js**, which communicates with multiple backend microservices through an API Gateway.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system follows a **microservices architecture**, consisting of:

* 🔐 **User Auth Service** – Handles authentication, authorization, and user management
* 💅 **Salon Catalog Service** – Manages available salon services
* 📅 **Booking Service** – Handles appointment reservations
* 💳 **Payment Service** – Processes payments
* 🌐 **API Gateway** – Central entry point for all frontend requests

## 🔐 Authentication Flow
